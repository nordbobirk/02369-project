## Cloning the project

1. Install Node.js version 22 from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (use the prebuilt installers available below the Docker installation). Node.js is a runtime which allows execution of Javascript on the server and is essential for a Next.js project.
2. Clone the project (use GitHub Desktop or `git clone`)
3. In the project directory run `npm i`, which installs the dependencies for the project.
4. To test correct cloning, run `npm run dev`, which should start the development server on `localhost:3000`
